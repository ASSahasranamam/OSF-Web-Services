== Introduction ==

'''OSF''' is a platform-independent Web services framework for accessing and exposing structured [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/RDF_Concept RDF] (Resource Description Framework) data. Its central organizing perspective is that of the dataset. These datasets contain instance records, with the structural relationships amongst the data and their attributes and concepts defined via ontologies (schema with accompanying vocabularies).

The OSF middleware framework is [http://www.mkbergman.com/?p=499 generally] [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/REST_Concept RESTful] in design and is based on HTTP and Web protocols and open standards. The initial OSF framework comes packaged with a baseline set of more than 20 Web services in [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/CRUD_Concept CRUD], browse, search, tagging, ontology management, and export and import. All Web services are exposed via APIs and SPARQL endpoints. Each request to an individual Web service returns an HTTP status and optionally a document of ''resultsets''. Each results document can be serialized in many ways, and may be expressed as either RDF, pure XML, JSON, or different flavors of [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/Introduction_to_irON irON].

In initial release, OSF has direct interfaces to the [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/Virtuoso Virtuoso] RDF triple store (via ODBC, and later HTTP) and the [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/Solr Solr] faceted, full-text search engine(via HTTP). However, OSF has been designed to be fully platform-independent. Support for additional datastores and engines are planned. The design also allows other specialized systems to be included, such as analysis or advanced inference engines.

The framework is open source (Apache 2 license) and designed for extensibility. OSF and its extensions and enhancements are distributed and documented on the '''Open Semantic Framework''' [http://opensemanticframework.org/  Web site].

You can read more about [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/Open_Semantic_Framework OSF here]

== Documentation ==

OSF is fully documented on the [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org Techwiki]. You can easily access all the documentation pages related to it by checking this [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/Category:Open_Semantic_Framework category section].

== Architecture ==

The general OSF architecture is described in this [http://wiki.opensemanticframework.org/index.php/OSF_Web_Service_Architecture document page]. It also explains the echosystem in which it lives (and its related to other parts of the OSF (Open Semantic Framework) like [http://drupal.org/project/osf OSF for Drupal].

== Installing OSF ==

Additionally you can find debugging tips and support on the [http://groups.google.com/group/open-semantic-framework Mailing List]

== Upgrading OSF ==

An existing OSF instance can easily be upgrader using the [https://github.com/structureddynamics/Open-Semantic-Framework-Installer OSF-Installer].

Note: the version of the OSF instance that should be minimally installed is version 3.0.0. If you have an older version than that, then you will have to manually upgrade your version to the version 3.0.0 and then you will have to run the OSF-Installer OSF upgrader script.

== How to Use Web Services Endpoint ==

The easiest way to get started is to use the [https://github.com/StructuredDynamics/OSF-Web-Services-PHP-API OSF Web Services PHP API] to create and send queries to any OSF web service endpoint.

== Developers ==

Developers and commiters to the Git repository should comply to the coding standards. An outline of the coding style is available in the Coding Standard folder. Additional requirements are listed in the README.mediawiki file in that folder. Finally, coding style is enforced b the PolyStyle code formatter application available here: http://polystyle.com

==Auto-loading of Classes==

OSF does comply with the [PSR-0 Standard Document](https://gist.github.com/1234504) 
for auto-loading the classes of the framework. The SplClassLoader class that has been developed by
the same group can be used as the classes auto-loader.
