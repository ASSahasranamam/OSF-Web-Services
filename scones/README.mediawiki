== Introduction ==

The scones (subject concepts or named entities) tagger is how you identify and then tag information in document and text content in accordance with the ontology or named entities common to your domain. 

== Installation ==

To install Scones, you have to install a few other softwares as well. Briefly, what you will need is:

# A running Tomcat instance
# Gate ran by the Tomcat install
# Php/Java Bridge
# A working Gate application

== Configuration ==

The goal is to create a Gate application using the Gate Developer application. Then to use that Gate application to run on the Tomcat instance. It is that instance that will be used by the Scones web service endpoint. The Gate application will use the OWL ontology with some named entities dictionaries to tag documents.

To make this structWSF endpoint operational, you will have to deploy the Scones backend application on Tomcat6. You can download the <code>Scones.war</code> application directly on the [https://github.com/structureddynamics/Scones Scones GitHub project here]. Then take the time to read the README file on that project page to know how to deploy the application, and how to configure everything.
